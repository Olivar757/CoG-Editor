# CoG-Editor
Editor for use on settings.xml files generated from games from the publisher Choice of Games LLC.

I've always wanted save editor for novels published by Choice of Games LLC, and quarantine gave me the opportunity to try and make one. This is the app in its simplest version since I've never created a desktop application before.
If you find any bugs or something doesn't work, email me at COGeditor20@gmail.com, and I'll try and figure out a solution.

Working with the following novels:
  - Silverworld
  - Werewolves: Haven Rising
  
Known issues:
  - Last entry of tab # is also the first entry of tab (# + 1)
  - Current tests show the editor can't handle games that utilize saves from previous books (i.e. Werewolves 2)
